# Introduction to GLM's with R

This short tutorial introduces you to using GLM models for regression in R. In particular we show you how to work with the model objects for generating predictions and plotting. We simulate some data and look at models for count data (poisson and negative binomial models).

Along the way we show you a couple of often used functions, `purrr:map` for data iteration, and `broom:tidy` for extracting coefficients.
